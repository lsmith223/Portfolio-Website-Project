        Version: 1.4, 11/14/25
        Description: Added and finalized most CSS and most pages, added javascript for image gallery on portfolio page (still in progress), w/ placeholder images (not finalized)
        images still need to be cropped, finalized, and compressed in some cases w/o losing their detail, & images will need captions & minor CSS 
        Finalized resume, index, TOU, & about me pages. Mostly finalized awards page, but may change
        Added further mobile & scaling capabilities for all possible elements, to ensure all pages and content are readable on every possible pixel width
        Also fixed some centering issues with the navbars and footer, and some elements not being fully centered correctly
        Started contact me page. Also started a dark mode button, but will probably be deleted in the future as I couldn't find any dark colors that looked good w/ the page. 
        To do: finish portfolio page, finish contact me page, & finalize website
